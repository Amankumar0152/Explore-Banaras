    <p>All bookings must be confirmed via our official booking system. We will provide you with a confirmation message after successful submission of the form.</p>

    <h2>2. Optional Advance Payment</h2>
    <p>To ensure booking authenticity, we may ask for a ₹200 optional advance payment. This amount will be adjusted in your final payment after the tour is completed. This step helps us verify genuine bookings and prevent last-minute cancellations.</p>

    <h2>4. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your booking anytime by contacting us. If you paid the ₹200 advance and cancel the tour at least 12 hours before the scheduled start, the amount will be refunded. No refund is applicable for last-minute cancellations.</p>

    <h2>5. Tour Timing & Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Please be on time for your tour. If you are late beyond 15 minutes, the guide reserves the right to cancel or shorten the tour without refund.</p>
