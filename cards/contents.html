      Varanasi, or Benaras, (also known as Kashi) is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Varanasi`s Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Varanasi is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old as all of them put together.

        To be in Varanasi is an experience in itself, an experience in self–discovery and eternal oneness of the body and soul. To every visitor; Varanasi offers a breathtaking experience. The rays of the dawn shimmering across the Ganges, the high-banks, the temples and shrines along the banks bathed in a golden hue soul stirring hymns and mantras along with the fragrance of incense filling the air. In this intoxicating ‘city of widows’, where funeral pyres smoulder beside the river in which thousands of pilgrims bathe, and, you discovers a remarkable interplay between death and life, light and dark.
